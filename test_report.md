   - ✅ Basic navigation works

2. **User Authentication System**:
   - ⚠️ Partial - Registration works but authentication doesn't persist
   - ❌ Role-based access control not functioning

3. **Core Features**:
   - ✅ States API returns all 58 Algerian states
   - ❌ Driving school browsing shows no schools
   - ❌ Student enrollment workflow fails
   - ✅ Multi-language support works (Arabic, French, English)
   - ✅ Offline quiz UI is present but functionality not tested

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - ❌ Quiz system - Not functional
   - ❌ Video call integration - Not tested
   - ❌ Document upload system - Not tested
   - ❌ Session scheduling - Not tested
   - ❌ Certificate generation - Not tested
   - ❌ Notification system - Not tested
   - ❌ Analytics dashboard - Not tested

## Recommendations

1. **Critical Fixes**:
   - Fix authentication system to properly validate tokens
   - Add sample driving schools to the database
   - Fix enrollment process

2. **Secondary Improvements**:
   - Implement proper error handling in the frontend
   - Add loading states for API calls
   - Implement proper validation for forms

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Add unit tests for backend API endpoints
   - Add integration tests for frontend-backend communication

## Conclusion

The Driving School Platform is **not 100% complete** as claimed. While the basic infrastructure is in place, there are significant issues with authentication and core functionality that prevent the platform from being usable in its current state. The frontend UI is well-designed and responsive, but the backend API has authentication issues that prevent most features from working properly.

**Overall Completion Status: ~30%**

- Basic infrastructure: 90% complete
- Authentication system: 40% complete
- Core features: 20% complete
- Advanced features: 0% complete
